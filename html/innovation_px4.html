        <h2>Vertical Farming</h2>
        <p>
          Vertical farming is the practice of growing crops in vertically
          stacked layers. It uses artificial lighting and a controlled
          environment to grow crops year-round. This technology can increase
          crop yields and reduce water usage.

        <h2>Precision Agriculture:</h2>
        <p>
          Precision agriculture is the use of technology to optimize crop
          production. It involves using sensors, drones, and GPS to collect data
          on soil conditions, water usage, and plant growth. This data is then
          used to make decisions on when and how to fertilize, irrigate, and
          harvest crops.

        <h2>Autonomous Tractors:</h2>
        <p>
          Autonomous tractors are self-driving vehicles that can be used to plow
          fields, plant crops, and harvest them. They use GPS and sensors to
          navigate the fields and can work around the clock without the need for
          a driver.
